# Graphics

This works are according to my lab assignments

To run 'Ray Tracing' code,add the main.cpp file to an OpenGL project,provide an input.txt file and run the code.

 * Press 0 to create an image 
 * Press 'SPACE' to enable or disable texture mode
 * Press 0 in texture mode to create textured image.A texture.bmp file should be provided to do this.
 
 To run 'Raster Based Graphics Simulation' just run the main file with a input file named 'scene.txt'
 
'bitmap_image.hpp' is necessary to run both 'Ray Tracing' and 'Raster Based Graphics Simulation' codes.
